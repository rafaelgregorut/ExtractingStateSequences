\chapter{Implementation of test case generation for statecharts}
\label{cap:testgen}

%In this section, we will be concerned with test case creation from the functional perspective. The structure of the code will not be analyzed. Instead, the specifications with the requisites are going to be the source to derive the test cases.

In this project, we implemented the test case generation for statecharts based on the criteria described in \cite{bogdanov}. We test every transition by visiting every state and trigger events for all transitions that start in it. Our implementation receives as input a statechart created using Yakindu Statechart Tools \cite{Yakindu} and outputs the test cases.
