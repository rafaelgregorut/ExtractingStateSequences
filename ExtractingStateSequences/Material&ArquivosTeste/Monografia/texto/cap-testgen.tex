\chapter{Test cases}
\label{cap:testgen}

In this section, we will be concerned with test case creation from the functional perspective. The structure of the code will not be analyzed. Instead, the specifications with the requisites are going to be the source to derive the test cases.

\section{Automatic generation of test cases}

A model, a statechart for instance, can also be used to specify certain scenarios and funcionalities relevant to the software. Considering that such model is correct, one can use it to automatically generate functional test cases \cite{Maldonado:07}. This technique, in which test cases are automatically derived from a model, is called Model Based Test.
