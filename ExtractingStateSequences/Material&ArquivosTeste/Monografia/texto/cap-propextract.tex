\chapter{Property extraction from test cases}
\label{cap:propextract}

In this section we propose a technique to automatically create formal properties from the test cases generated in the previous chapter. We will apply the mining concepts and algorithm presented in section \ref{sec-seqmining} to extract patterns, which will later be used to derive the properties.
