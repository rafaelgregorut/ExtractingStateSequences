\chapter{Property extraction from test cases}
\label{cap:propextract}

In this chapter we propose a technique to automatically create formal properties from the test cases generated in the previous chapter. Since a great number of test cases might be generated, we should be able to identify the more relevant fragment of them. In order to do so, we will apply the mining concepts and algorithm presented in section \ref{sec-seqmining} to extract patterns, which will later be used to derive the properties.
