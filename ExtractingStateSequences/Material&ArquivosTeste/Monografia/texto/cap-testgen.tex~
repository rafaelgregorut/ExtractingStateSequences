\chapter{Test case generation}
\label{cap:testgen}

For this section, we will be concerned with test case creation from the functional perspective. The structure of the code will not be analyzed. Instead, the structure of the specification along with the requisites are going to be the source to derive the test cases.

Typically, the specification is delivered and the test cases are created based on the specification.
